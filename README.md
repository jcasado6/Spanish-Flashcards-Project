# Spanish Flashcards 

## Description 
This project is was developed in order to help the user study simple words in spanish. 

## Technologies Used
- HTML5
- CSS3 
- Vanilla JavaScript

## Getting Started 
Follow the link (https://jcasado6.github.io/Spanish-Flashcards-Project/) and select the category you would like to study. Hover over the desired card and it will flip and give the translation for the word. The use can change categories when they desire. 

## Approach Taken 
The cards were built with an unordered lists of divs then styling them to remove their bullet points and styling them to their individual size. DOM manipulation and Event listeners were utilized on the category buttons in order to set the the display of the selected category to blcok and the others to none. 

## Unsolved Problems 
One of the unsolved issues I ran into were getting the individual cards to flip on click. The issue was solved by using a flip animation via CSS. That led to another issue, which was slide in animation staying acting while the flip animation was being utilized. My plan is to go back and get the cards to flip on click and get rid of the flip animation.
