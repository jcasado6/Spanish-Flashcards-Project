# Spanish Flashcards 

## Technologies Used
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript

## Description & Features
This project is was developed in order to help the user study simple words in spanish via flashcards. 

## Getting Started 
Visit the applications deployed url [here](https://jcasado6.github.io/Spanish-Flashcards-Project/) and select the category you would like to study. Hover over the desired card and it will flip and give the translation for the word. The user can change categories when they desire. 

## Approach Taken 
The cards were built with an unordered lists of divs then styling them to remove their bullet points and styling them to their individual size. DOM manipulation and Event listeners were utilized on the category buttons in order to set the the display of the selected category to block and the others to none. 

## Goals
In the future, I would like to improve this project by...
* Making the application responsive and mobile friendly.
* Have the cards flip utilizing JavaScript instead of CSS animations.
* Implement more categories of words that the user can select from to study.
* Build a quiz feature for each category where the user can test their knowledge.
